I'm currently studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the [University of the Free State](https://www.ufs.ac.za/) exploring how software, logic and code all come together to build meaningful tech, thus I lean mostly towards backend technologies and development. I'm especially drawn to the connections between the beautiful structure of Mathematics, from the fundamentals to advanced concepts, and the real world, how it influences our thinking and shapes impact, and I love to see code come to life.
### ðŸ’¡ Learning & Tools
- Languages: Python, C#, JavaScript  
- Web: HTML, CSS (and a sprinkle of React)  
- Tools: VS Code, VS19, Git & GitHub  
- Curious About: APIs, Databases, and Mobile App & Game Development amongst others
